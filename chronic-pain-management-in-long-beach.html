      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, we accept most major insurance plans including Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, United Healthcare, and Medicare. For patients without insurance, initial consultations are $125, which includes examination and treatment planning. Regular adjustment visits thereafter range from $75-95 depending on the treatment required. We also offer package plans for ongoing care that can reduce per-visit costs. Our staff will verify your insurance coverage before your first appointment and explain any out-of-pocket expenses."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Treatment plans are highly individualized, but most of our chronic pain patients initially visit 2-3 times per week for 4-6 weeks. As improvement occurs, visits typically reduce to once per week, then monthly maintenance visits. Many of our Long Beach patients see significant improvement within 6-8 weeks, though complex cases may require longer care. We continuously evaluate progress and adjust treatment plans based on your response to care."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "We utilize multiple techniques including traditional manual adjustments, the gentle Activator Method, and Cox Flexion-Distraction, tailored to your comfort level and condition. Dr. Williams is certified in these techniques with 15 years of experience. While adjustments aren't typically painful, you may experience mild soreness for 12-24 hours afterward, similar to after exercise. We also incorporate therapeutic exercises and lifestyle recommendations to support long-term pain management."

        "text": "No, New York State law allows direct access to chiropractic care without a referral. However, if you're using insurance, some plans may require a referral for coverage. We're happy to coordinate with your primary care physician and can provide them with treatment updates. If you're unsure about your insurance requirements, our office staff can verify this for you before your first visit."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "We carefully monitor progress through regular assessments and documented pain levels. If you're not responding as expected after 4-6 visits, we'll modify your treatment approach or refer you to other specialists in the Long Beach medical community as needed. We have established relationships with local orthopedists, pain management specialists, and physical therapists. We don't want patients continuing treatment that isn't helping - our goal is your improvement, even if that means referring you to another provider."

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Been dealing with lower back pain for years from an old surfing injury. Dr. Chen at Well Being has been treating me for about 4 months now and I'm finally getting back to doing the things I love. The first few sessions were pretty intense (not gonna lie, some discomfort), but she really knows her stuff. The office staff is super chill too - they're great about working with my schedule since I can only come in after 5pm. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is sometimes the wait time can be a bit long, but the treatment itself is worth it.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Life changing!! After my car accident last year, I could barely turn my neck. Tried physical therapy and pain meds but nothing helped until I found Well Being. Dr. Sanders took the time to explain everything and created a treatment plan that actually worked. 3 months later and I'm almost back to normal. The massage therapist Janet is amazing too. A bit pricey but my insurance covered most of it. Highly recommend!!!!</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">straight to the point - if you've got back problems, these folks know what they're doing. been going twice a month for maintenance adjustments since last summer. dr chen fixed my sciatica when nobody else could. parking can be a pain during beach season but whatever. they take my insurance and the front desk actually knows what they're talking about with billing.</div>

                        <summary>Do you accept insurance? What are your typical treatment costs without insurance?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Yes, we accept most major insurance plans including Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, United Healthcare, and Medicare. For patients without insurance, initial consultations are $125, which includes examination and treatment planning. Regular adjustment visits thereafter range from $75-95 depending on the treatment required. We also offer package plans for ongoing care that can reduce per-visit costs. Our staff will verify your insurance coverage before your first appointment and explain any out-of-pocket expenses.</div>

                        <summary>How long does a typical treatment plan last for chronic back pain?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Treatment plans are highly individualized, but most of our chronic pain patients initially visit 2-3 times per week for 4-6 weeks. As improvement occurs, visits typically reduce to once per week, then monthly maintenance visits. Many of our Long Beach patients see significant improvement within 6-8 weeks, though complex cases may require longer care. We continuously evaluate progress and adjust treatment plans based on your response to care.</div>

                        <summary>What techniques do you use for pain management, and are adjustments painful?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">We utilize multiple techniques including traditional manual adjustments, the gentle Activator Method, and Cox Flexion-Distraction, tailored to your comfort level and condition. Dr. Williams is certified in these techniques with 15 years of experience. While adjustments aren't typically painful, you may experience mild soreness for 12-24 hours afterward, similar to after exercise. We also incorporate therapeutic exercises and lifestyle recommendations to support long-term pain management.</div>

                        <summary>Do I need a referral from my primary care physician to visit your office?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">No, New York State law allows direct access to chiropractic care without a referral. However, if you're using insurance, some plans may require a referral for coverage. We're happy to coordinate with your primary care physician and can provide them with treatment updates. If you're unsure about your insurance requirements, our office staff can verify this for you before your first visit.</div>

                        <summary>What if I don't see improvement after several treatments?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">We carefully monitor progress through regular assessments and documented pain levels. If you're not responding as expected after 4-6 visits, we'll modify your treatment approach or refer you to other specialists in the Long Beach medical community as needed. We have established relationships with local orthopedists, pain management specialists, and physical therapists. We don't want patients continuing treatment that isn't helping - our goal is your improvement, even if that means referring you to another provider.</div>
