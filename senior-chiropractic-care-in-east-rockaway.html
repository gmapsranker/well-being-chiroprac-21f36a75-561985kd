        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, we accept Medicare and most major insurance plans at Well Being Chiropractic PC. Medicare typically covers chiropractic manipulations when deemed medically necessary. We also work with secondary insurances common in the East Rockaway area, including Blue Cross Blue Shield and United Healthcare. Our staff will verify your coverage before your first appointment and explain any out-of-pocket costs. We also offer affordable self-pay options for services not covered by insurance."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Your first visit will take approximately 60 minutes. Dr. Klein will begin with a detailed health history and discussion of your specific concerns. We'll perform a gentle physical examination focusing on your mobility, strength, and areas of discomfort. Our office is fully accessible with ground-level entry and comfortable treatment tables that adjust for easy access. We'll develop a personalized treatment plan that considers age-related conditions like arthritis or osteoporosis, and explain all procedures before beginning any treatment."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Treatment frequency varies based on your specific condition and health goals. Initially, many senior patients visit 2-3 times per week for 2-3 weeks. As improvement occurs, visits typically reduce to once weekly, then monthly for maintenance. We develop flexible treatment schedules that work with your lifestyle and transportation needs in East Rockaway. Our goal is to help you maintain mobility and comfort with the minimum number of visits necessary."

        "@type": "Answer",

Dr. Klein has over 15 years of experience working with senior patients and holds additional certifications in geriatric care. We coordinate with your primary care physician when needed and use very light pressure techniques like Activator Method or Cox Flexion-Distraction, rather than traditional high-velocity adjustments."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "While we don't regularly provide home visits, we can help coordinate transportation options to our office. We work with several local senior transportation services in East Rockaway and Nassau County. Our office is conveniently located near public transit routes, and we maintain relationships with reliable medical transport services. We can also schedule appointments to align with family member availability or existing transportation arrangements."

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Been seeing Dr. Marshall at Well Being for about 8 months now for my arthritis. At 72, I was hesitant to try chiropractic care, but my daughter insisted. So glad I listened! They really understand how to work with seniors - very patient and gentle. The office staff always helps me schedule appointments that don't interfere with my water aerobics class. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is sometimes the wait time can be 15-20 minutes, but the care itself is wonderful.</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Quick story - threw my back out playing with the grandkids last month. Could barely move! Called Well Being and they got me in same day. Dr. Sarah took time to explain everything, did some adjustments and gave me exercises I could actually do at home. Three visits later and I'm back to chasing those little rascals around again. Great with us older folks who don't heal as quick as we used to.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">My husband and I have been patients here since 2019. The doctors understand older bodies and don't try to push unnecessary treatments. They worked with my Medicare supplement plan which was a huge help. Dr. Marshall even noticed an issue with my gait that my regular doctor missed! Only suggestion - parking can be tricky during peak hours, try to book mid-morning if you can. Otherwise fantastic practice.</div>

                        <summary>Do you accept Medicare and other insurance for senior chiropractic care?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Yes, we accept Medicare and most major insurance plans at Well Being Chiropractic PC. Medicare typically covers chiropractic manipulations when deemed medically necessary. We also work with secondary insurances common in the East Rockaway area, including Blue Cross Blue Shield and United Healthcare. Our staff will verify your coverage before your first appointment and explain any out-of-pocket costs. We also offer affordable self-pay options for services not covered by insurance.</div>

                        <summary>What should I expect during my first visit as a senior patient?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Your first visit will take approximately 60 minutes. Dr. Klein will begin with a detailed health history and discussion of your specific concerns. We'll perform a gentle physical examination focusing on your mobility, strength, and areas of discomfort. Our office is fully accessible with ground-level entry and comfortable treatment tables that adjust for easy access. We'll develop a personalized treatment plan that considers age-related conditions like arthritis or osteoporosis, and explain all procedures before beginning any treatment.</div>

                        <summary>How often will I need to come in for treatments?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Treatment frequency varies based on your specific condition and health goals. Initially, many senior patients visit 2-3 times per week for 2-3 weeks. As improvement occurs, visits typically reduce to once weekly, then monthly for maintenance. We develop flexible treatment schedules that work with your lifestyle and transportation needs in East Rockaway. Our goal is to help you maintain mobility and comfort with the minimum number of visits necessary.</div>

                        <summary>Is chiropractic care safe for seniors with osteoporosis?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Yes, chiropractic care can be safe for seniors with osteoporosis when properly modified. We use gentle techniques specifically designed for older adults with bone density concerns. Dr. Klein has over 15 years of experience working with senior patients and holds additional certifications in geriatric care. We coordinate with your primary care physician when needed and use very light pressure techniques like Activator Method or Cox Flexion-Distraction, rather than traditional high-velocity adjustments.</div>

                        <summary>Do you provide home visits for seniors who can't easily travel to your East Rockaway office?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">While we don't regularly provide home visits, we can help coordinate transportation options to our office. We work with several local senior transportation services in East Rockaway and Nassau County. Our office is conveniently located near public transit routes, and we maintain relationships with reliable medical transport services. We can also schedule appointments to align with family member availability or existing transportation arrangements.</div>
