        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Our basic workplace ergonomic assessment starts at $225 for an individual evaluation that takes about 60-90 minutes. This includes a detailed analysis of your workstation, posture assessment, and personalized recommendations. For businesses requesting multiple employee assessments, we offer corporate rates starting at $175 per person when booking 5 or more assessments. Insurance may cover part of the cost - we accept most major insurance plans and can verify your coverage before the appointment."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "We offer both options. For the most accurate assessment, we prefer to evaluate you in your actual work environment. We provide on-site ergonomic assessments throughout Nassau County and parts of Suffolk County. However, if you're working remotely, you can also visit our Uniondale office at where we have various workspace setups for demonstration and assessment purposes. Virtual assessments are also available for those unable to meet in person."

Dr. Williams, our lead ergonomist, is certified by the Board of Certification in Professional Ergonomics (BCPE) and has over 12 years of experience in workplace ergonomic assessments. All our practitioners are licensed by the New York State Board of Chiropractic and maintain ongoing education in ergonomic best practices."

We then observe your working posture and evaluate your workspace setup, including chair height, monitor position, keyboard placement, and lighting. We use specialized tools to measure angles and distances. Photos may be taken (with permission) to analyze posture. Following the assessment, you'll receive a detailed written report with specific recommendations for equipment adjustments or modifications. We also demonstrate proper posture and stretching exercises tailored to your needs."

        "text": "We include one free follow-up consultation within 30 days of your initial assessment to fine-tune any recommendations. If you're still experiencing issues, we can schedule a reassessment at a reduced rate of $95. As a chiropractic clinic, we can also provide direct treatment for any underlying conditions that may be contributing to your discomfort. Many of our ergonomic assessment clients benefit from combining the assessment with targeted chiropractic care for optimal results."

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Been dealing with horrible desk-job posture for years. Dr. Chen at Well Being came to my office and did a really thorough workspace assessment. She adjusted my monitor height, suggested a new chair (gave specific recommendations), and showed me some stretches I could do during breaks. It's been about 2 months and my neck pain is so much better. Only giving 4 stars because the initial appointment wait time was pretty long - almost 3 weeks - but definitely worth it once I got in.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">This place is a lifesaver!! After my company switched to WFH, I started getting terrible lower back pain from working at my kitchen table. Dr. Peterson came over and completely reorganized my home office setup. He even noticed my laptop was too low and helped me create a makeshift standing desk option. Super friendly and knowledgeable without being pushy about extra services.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">ok so i was skeptical about spending $ on an ergonomic assessment but my HR dept recommended Well Being. honestly wasn't expecting much but Dr. Thompson actually found several issues with my workspace i hadn't noticed. helped me fix my chair settings (apparently i had it completely wrong lol) and showed me how to position my keyboard better. my wrist pain is like 75% better. only thing is parking can be tricky during peak hours. def recommend tho</div>

                        <summary>How much does an ergonomic assessment typically cost at Well Being Chiropractic?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Our basic workplace ergonomic assessment starts at $225 for an individual evaluation that takes about 60-90 minutes. This includes a detailed analysis of your workstation, posture assessment, and personalized recommendations. For businesses requesting multiple employee assessments, we offer corporate rates starting at $175 per person when booking 5 or more assessments. Insurance may cover part of the cost - we accept most major insurance plans and can verify your coverage before the appointment.</div>

                        <summary>Do I need to travel to your Uniondale office for the ergonomic assessment, or do you come to my workplace?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">We offer both options. For the most accurate assessment, we prefer to evaluate you in your actual work environment. We provide on-site ergonomic assessments throughout Nassau County and parts of Suffolk County. However, if you're working remotely, you can also visit our Uniondale office at where we have various workspace setups for demonstration and assessment purposes. Virtual assessments are also available for those unable to meet in person.</div>

                        <summary>What specific qualifications do your ergonomic assessors have?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Our ergonomic assessments are conducted by licensed chiropractors who hold additional certifications in occupational ergonomics. Dr. Williams, our lead ergonomist, is certified by the Board of Certification in Professional Ergonomics (BCPE) and has over 12 years of experience in workplace ergonomic assessments. All our practitioners are licensed by the New York State Board of Chiropractic and maintain ongoing education in ergonomic best practices.</div>

                        <summary>What exactly happens during an ergonomic assessment?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">The assessment begins with a brief health history and discussion of any current discomfort or concerns. We then observe your working posture and evaluate your workspace setup, including chair height, monitor position, keyboard placement, and lighting. We use specialized tools to measure angles and distances. Photos may be taken (with permission) to analyze posture. Following the assessment, you'll receive a detailed written report with specific recommendations for equipment adjustments or modifications. We also demonstrate proper posture and stretching exercises tailored to your needs.</div>

                        <summary>If I implement your ergonomic recommendations but still experience discomfort, what follow-up support do you provide?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">We include one free follow-up consultation within 30 days of your initial assessment to fine-tune any recommendations. If you're still experiencing issues, we can schedule a reassessment at a reduced rate of $95. As a chiropractic clinic, we can also provide direct treatment for any underlying conditions that may be contributing to your discomfort. Many of our ergonomic assessment clients benefit from combining the assessment with targeted chiropractic care for optimal results.</div>
