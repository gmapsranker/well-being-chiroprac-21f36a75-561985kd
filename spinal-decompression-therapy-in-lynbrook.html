        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The cost of spinal decompression therapy at our Lynbrook office typically ranges from $75-125 per session, with most treatment plans requiring 12-20 sessions for optimal results. We accept most major insurance plans, which may cover a portion of the treatment. We also offer package pricing and payment plans to help make treatment more affordable. During your initial consultation, we'll provide a detailed treatment plan with exact costs based on your specific condition and insurance coverage."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Each spinal decompression session at our Lynbrook clinic lasts approximately 30-45 minutes. A typical treatment protocol involves 2-3 sessions per week for 4-6 weeks, though this can vary based on your specific condition and response to treatment. The sessions themselves are non-invasive and painless, with most patients reporting they're quite relaxing. We recommend arriving 5-10 minutes before your scheduled appointment time, and you can usually return to normal activities immediately after treatment."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "At Well Being Chiropractic PC, we successfully treat various conditions with spinal decompression, including herniated or bulging discs, sciatica, degenerative disc disease, and chronic lower back pain. However, not everyone is a candidate for this treatment. Patients with severe osteoporosis, spinal fractures, surgical fusion hardware, or advanced degenerative joint disease may need alternative treatments. During your initial consultation, we'll perform a thorough evaluation to determine if spinal decompression is the right option for your specific condition."

        "text": "No, you don't need a referral to receive treatment at our Lynbrook office. New York State allows direct access to chiropractic care. However, if you're planning to use insurance, some plans may require a referral for coverage. We recommend checking with your insurance provider regarding their specific requirements. We're happy to work with your primary care physician and can provide them with treatment updates if desired."

You'll complete initial paperwork (which you can download from our website to save time), followed by a comprehensive consultation with one of our licensed chiropractors. We'll review your medical history, perform a physical examination, and may take X-rays if necessary. Based on our findings, we'll develop a customized treatment plan and discuss all costs and insurance coverage upfront. Please bring any recent imaging results, a list of medications, and your insurance card. Wear comfortable clothing that allows easy movement."

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Been dealing with lower back pain for years from sitting at a desk job. Dr. Chen at Well Being really took the time to explain what was going on with my spine and set up a treatment plan that made sense. The spinal decompression therapy was a game changer - started feeling relief after about 4-5 sessions. Office staff is super friendly too, especially Maria at the front desk who always helps me with my insurance paperwork. Only giving 4 stars because sometimes the wait time can be a bit long, but the actual treatment is worth it.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Thank god for this place!! After my car accident last summer, I could barely turn my neck. Tried physical therapy for 2 months with barely any improvement. Dr. Chen recommended a combination of adjustments and decompression therapy 2x week. It's been about 3 months and I'm almost back to normal. Not gonna lie - the first few sessions were a little uncomfortable but they really know what they're doing. The massage therapist Lisa is amazing too!</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Quick review - been going here for about 6 weeks for herniated disc treatment. Clean office, good COVID protocols still in place. Dr. Chen explains everything clearly and doesn't try to sell you stuff you don't need. Spinal decompression takes about 30 mins each session. My insurance covered most of it. Definitely seeing improvement in my sciatica pain.</div>

                        <summary>How much does spinal decompression therapy cost at Well Being Chiropractic PC?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">The cost of spinal decompression therapy at our Lynbrook office typically ranges from $75-125 per session, with most treatment plans requiring 12-20 sessions for optimal results. We accept most major insurance plans, which may cover a portion of the treatment. We also offer package pricing and payment plans to help make treatment more affordable. During your initial consultation, we'll provide a detailed treatment plan with exact costs based on your specific condition and insurance coverage.</div>

                        <summary>How long does each spinal decompression session take, and how often will I need treatment?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Each spinal decompression session at our Lynbrook clinic lasts approximately 30-45 minutes. A typical treatment protocol involves 2-3 sessions per week for 4-6 weeks, though this can vary based on your specific condition and response to treatment. The sessions themselves are non-invasive and painless, with most patients reporting they're quite relaxing. We recommend arriving 5-10 minutes before your scheduled appointment time, and you can usually return to normal activities immediately after treatment.</div>

                        <summary>What conditions can be treated with spinal decompression at your clinic?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">At Well Being Chiropractic PC, we successfully treat various conditions with spinal decompression, including herniated or bulging discs, sciatica, degenerative disc disease, and chronic lower back pain. However, not everyone is a candidate for this treatment. Patients with severe osteoporosis, spinal fractures, surgical fusion hardware, or advanced degenerative joint disease may need alternative treatments. During your initial consultation, we'll perform a thorough evaluation to determine if spinal decompression is the right option for your specific condition.</div>

                        <summary>Do I need a referral from my primary care physician to receive treatment at Well Being Chiropractic PC?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">No, you don't need a referral to receive treatment at our Lynbrook office. New York State allows direct access to chiropractic care. However, if you're planning to use insurance, some plans may require a referral for coverage. We recommend checking with your insurance provider regarding their specific requirements. We're happy to work with your primary care physician and can provide them with treatment updates if desired.</div>

Please bring any recent imaging results, a list of medications, and your insurance card. Wear comfortable clothing that allows easy movement.</div>
