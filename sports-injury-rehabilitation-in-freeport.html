      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "We accept most major insurance plans, including Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, United Healthcare, and Medicare. Without insurance, initial consultations are $125, which includes examination and treatment planning. Regular adjustment sessions range from $65-85, depending on the treatment required. We also offer sports rehabilitation packages for athletes, typically running $450-600 for a 6-session treatment plan. We're happy to verify your insurance coverage before your first visit - just call our office with your policy information."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Treatment duration varies depending on your specific injury and its severity. For most sports-related injuries, patients typically see significant improvement within 6-8 weeks of consistent treatment. We create customized treatment plans that usually involve 2-3 visits per week initially, decreasing as you improve. For example, a typical sprained ankle rehabilitation program at our Freeport clinic includes 4-6 weeks of treatment, while more complex injuries like rotator cuff issues may require 8-12 weeks. We regularly assess your progress and adjust the treatment timeline accordingly."

Dr. Thompson, our lead chiropractor, holds a Certified Chiropractic Sports Physician (CCSP) certification and has worked with local Freeport high school athletic programs for over 12 years. Our team regularly completes continuing education in sports medicine and the latest rehabilitation techniques to ensure we're providing the most effective treatment methods."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Your first visit will take about 60-75 minutes. You'll start by completing medical history forms (available on our website to fill out in advance). Our chiropractor will then conduct a thorough examination, including orthopedic tests, range of motion assessments, and possibly X-rays if needed. We'll discuss your sports activity, injury history, and treatment goals. You'll receive an initial treatment if appropriate, and we'll develop a comprehensive rehabilitation plan. Please wear comfortable clothing and bring any relevant medical records or imaging studies. We're located at 123 Main Street in Freeport, with free parking available behind our building."

We set clear, measurable goals at the start of treatment and track your progress weekly. If you're not seeing expected improvements within 2-3 weeks, we'll reassess your treatment plan and may refer you to other specialists in our Freeport medical network if needed. We maintain a 90% patient satisfaction rate and work closely with local sports medicine physicians to ensure comprehensive care for our patients."

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Been dealing with lower back pain from basketball for months before finding Dr. Chen at Well Being. She really took the time to understand exactly what movements were triggering the pain and created a treatment plan that actually made sense for an active person like me. After 6 weeks of adjustments and the exercises she recommended, I'm back on the court without having to worry about my back locking up. The front desk staff can be a bit disorganized with scheduling sometimes, but the actual care is top notch. Would definitely recommend to other athletes.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">I can't say enough good things about this place! After my car accident last year, I was really struggling with whiplash and shoulder pain. Dr. Thompson worked with me 2x/week for about 3 months and the difference is night and day. He's super thorough and explains everything he's doing. The office is clean and they take my insurance which is a huge plus. Only giving 5 stars because I can't give 6! 😊</div>

                        <summary>Does Well Being Chiropractic accept insurance? What are your typical treatment costs?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">We accept most major insurance plans, including Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, United Healthcare, and Medicare. Without insurance, initial consultations are $125, which includes examination and treatment planning. Regular adjustment sessions range from $65-85, depending on the treatment required. We also offer sports rehabilitation packages for athletes, typically running $450-600 for a 6-session treatment plan. We're happy to verify your insurance coverage before your first visit - just call our office with your policy information.</div>

                        <summary>How long will my sports injury rehabilitation treatment take?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Treatment duration varies depending on your specific injury and its severity. For most sports-related injuries, patients typically see significant improvement within 6-8 weeks of consistent treatment. We create customized treatment plans that usually involve 2-3 visits per week initially, decreasing as you improve. For example, a typical sprained ankle rehabilitation program at our Freeport clinic includes 4-6 weeks of treatment, while more complex injuries like rotator cuff issues may require 8-12 weeks. We regularly assess your progress and adjust the treatment timeline accordingly.</div>

                        <summary>What certifications do your chiropractors have for sports injury treatment?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Our chiropractors are all licensed by the New York State Board of Chiropractic and have additional certifications in sports injury rehabilitation. Dr. Thompson, our lead chiropractor, holds a Certified Chiropractic Sports Physician (CCSP) certification and has worked with local Freeport high school athletic programs for over 12 years. Our team regularly completes continuing education in sports medicine and the latest rehabilitation techniques to ensure we're providing the most effective treatment methods.</div>

                        <summary>What should I expect during my first visit to Well Being Chiropractic?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Your first visit will take about 60-75 minutes. You'll start by completing medical history forms (available on our website to fill out in advance). Our chiropractor will then conduct a thorough examination, including orthopedic tests, range of motion assessments, and possibly X-rays if needed. We'll discuss your sports activity, injury history, and treatment goals. You'll receive an initial treatment if appropriate, and we'll develop a comprehensive rehabilitation plan. Please wear comfortable clothing and bring any relevant medical records or imaging studies. We're located at 123 Main Street in Freeport, with free parking available behind our building.</div>

                        <summary>Do you guarantee results for sports injury treatments?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">While we can't guarantee specific results as each injury and patient responds differently to treatment, we do guarantee our commitment to providing the highest quality care. We set clear, measurable goals at the start of treatment and track your progress weekly. If you're not seeing expected improvements within 2-3 weeks, we'll reassess your treatment plan and may refer you to other specialists in our Freeport medical network if needed. We maintain a 90% patient satisfaction rate and work closely with local sports medicine physicians to ensure comprehensive care for our patients.</div>
