We also work with flexible spending accounts (FSA) and health savings accounts (HSA). Before your child's first visit, we'll verify your coverage and explain any out-of-pocket costs. For families without insurance, we offer affordable self-pay rates starting at $75 per pediatric adjustment."

Dr. Johnson has over 15 years of specialized pediatric chiropractic experience and holds additional certifications in pediatric care. Many parents bring their babies in as early as a few weeks old for issues like colic, latching difficulties, or after difficult births. We use extremely gentle techniques specifically designed for infants and children, with pressure no greater than testing the ripeness of a tomato."

This includes a thorough examination, health history review, and your child's first adjustment if appropriate. Follow-up visits usually last 20-30 minutes. We know children can be anxious about new experiences, so we take time to help them feel comfortable. Our office is kid-friendly with a dedicated play area in the waiting room."

We also work with children who have sensory processing disorders, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorders. Each treatment plan is customized to your child's specific needs and development stage. We collaborate with your child's pediatrician when beneficial for their care."

We're happy to communicate with your child's pediatrician and provide progress updates. Many local pediatricians in Nassau County regularly refer patients to us. We can schedule a free 15-minute phone consultation to discuss your child's specific needs and answer any questions before your first visit."

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Dr. Chen has been amazing with my 3-year-old son who was having terrible sleep issues. I was honestly skeptical about taking a toddler to a chiropractor, but after 2 months of regular visits, the improvement is incredible. She's so patient and gentle - my son actually looks forward to his appointments! The office staff is super helpful with scheduling too. Only minor complaint is sometimes the wait can be 15-20 mins, but honestly worth it for the quality of care we get.</div>
                    <div class="testimonial-author">– Maria R., Baldwin</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Finally found a chiro who gets it! Been bringing my kids (7 and 9) here since last summer. Dr. Chen helped my daughter with her chronic ear infections - went from having them every other month to none in the past 6 months. The office isn't fancy but it's clean and kid-friendly. They have these little tablets in the waiting room which helps keep the kids occupied. Prices are reasonable compared to other places I checked out.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Quick review - brought my 18mo here for colic issues. Was nervous at first but Dr. Chen is seriously a baby whisperer! She explained everything clearly and didn't push for unnecessary visits. My baby's so much happier now. Only giving 4 stars bc parking can be a pain during peak hours but the treatment itself is great. Been coming here 3 months now.</div>

                        <summary>Do you accept insurance for pediatric chiropractic care?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Yes, Well Being Chiropractic PC accepts most major insurance plans including Empire BCBS, United Healthcare, Cigna, and Aetna. We also work with flexible spending accounts (FSA) and health savings accounts (HSA). Before your child's first visit, we'll verify your coverage and explain any out-of-pocket costs. For families without insurance, we offer affordable self-pay rates starting at $75 per pediatric adjustment.</div>

                        <summary>At what age can my child start receiving chiropractic care?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">We safely provide chiropractic care for children of all ages, including newborns. Dr. Johnson has over 15 years of specialized pediatric chiropractic experience and holds additional certifications in pediatric care. Many parents bring their babies in as early as a few weeks old for issues like colic, latching difficulties, or after difficult births. We use extremely gentle techniques specifically designed for infants and children, with pressure no greater than testing the ripeness of a tomato.</div>

                        <summary>How long does a pediatric adjustment appointment typically take?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Initial consultations at our Baldwin office typically take 45-60 minutes. This includes a thorough examination, health history review, and your child's first adjustment if appropriate. Follow-up visits usually last 20-30 minutes. We know children can be anxious about new experiences, so we take time to help them feel comfortable. Our office is kid-friendly with a dedicated play area in the waiting room.</div>

We can schedule a free 15-minute phone consultation to discuss your child's specific needs and answer any questions before your first visit.</div>
