We frequently collaborate with healthcare providers in Nassau County to ensure coordinated care during your pregnancy. We can also provide you with documentation of your treatment to share with your prenatal care team."

This includes a comprehensive evaluation, review of your pregnancy history, postural assessment, gentle spinal examination, and your first adjustment if appropriate. We accept most major insurance plans and can verify your coverage before your visit. For self-pay patients, we offer flexible payment plans and packages for ongoing care throughout your pregnancy."

Our tables have special belly cutouts and adjustable sections to accommodate your changing body. We modify all techniques based on your stage of pregnancy and comfort level. Dr. Williams has over 15 years of experience working with pregnant patients and maintains current certification in prenatal chiropractic care."

For C-section deliveries, we recommend waiting 3-4 weeks and getting clearance from your doctor. We'll do a gentle evaluation and focus on supporting your recovery, addressing nursing posture, and helping your body adjust to caring for your newborn."

        "text": "Treatment frequency varies based on your specific needs and symptoms. Typically, we recommend visits every 2-3 weeks during the first and second trimesters, increasing to weekly visits in the third trimester as your body undergoes more rapid changes. Each visit takes about 20-30 minutes. We're conveniently located near Oceanside Road and offer early morning and evening appointments to accommodate working mothers. We can adjust this schedule based on your symptoms, comfort level, and birth preparation needs."

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Dr. Miller has been amazing throughout my pregnancy! I started seeing her around week 20 when my back pain was getting unbearable. After just 3 sessions, I noticed a huge difference. She's super gentle and always explains what she's doing. The office staff is pretty good about scheduling too - I've only had to wait more than 10 mins once or twice. Only giving 4 stars because parking can be a real pain sometimes, but the care itself is top notch.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Been bringing my wife here for postpartum care since January. What a difference! She was having such bad neck pain from nursing our twins, but Dr. Miller helped adjust her posture and gave us some exercises to do at home. The office isn't fancy but it's clean and they're great with last-minute appointments when needed. Worth the 15-minute drive from Long Beach.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">tbh i was super nervous about seeing a chiropractor while pregnant (first time mom here!) but my obgyn recommended Well Being and im so glad she did!! dr miller is literally the most patient person ever and answered all my million questions lol. she helped with my sciatic pain & showed me some stretches i can do at home. only downside is sometimes they run a bit behind schedule but honestly worth the wait. been going 2x month since week 25 and feeling so much better!!</div>

                        <summary>Do I need a referral from my OB-GYN to receive prenatal chiropractic care at Well Being Chiropractic?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">No, you don't need a referral to visit our Oceanside office. However, we do recommend informing your OB-GYN or midwife that you're seeking chiropractic care. We frequently collaborate with healthcare providers in Nassau County to ensure coordinated care during your pregnancy. We can also provide you with documentation of your treatment to share with your prenatal care team.</div>

                        <summary>What does the first prenatal adjustment visit cost and what's included?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Your initial visit is $150 and typically takes 60-75 minutes. This includes a comprehensive evaluation, review of your pregnancy history, postural assessment, gentle spinal examination, and your first adjustment if appropriate. We accept most major insurance plans and can verify your coverage before your visit.

                        <summary>Is chiropractic care safe throughout all stages of pregnancy?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Yes, our chiropractors are specially certified in the Webster Technique and prenatal care. We use pregnancy-specific adjusting tables and techniques that are safe for all trimesters. Our tables have special belly cutouts and adjustable sections to accommodate your changing body. We modify all techniques based on your stage of pregnancy and comfort level.

                        <summary>How soon after giving birth can I come in for postpartum care?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">You can begin postpartum care as soon as you feel comfortable traveling to our office. For vaginal births without complications, many patients come in within 1-2 weeks postpartum. For C-section deliveries, we recommend waiting 3-4 weeks and getting clearance from your doctor. We'll do a gentle evaluation and focus on supporting your recovery, addressing nursing posture, and helping your body adjust to caring for your newborn.</div>

                        <summary>How frequently will I need to come in during my pregnancy?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Treatment frequency varies based on your specific needs and symptoms. Typically, we recommend visits every 2-3 weeks during the first and second trimesters, increasing to weekly visits in the third trimester as your body undergoes more rapid changes. Each visit takes about 20-30 minutes. We're conveniently located near Oceanside Road and offer early morning and evening appointments to accommodate working mothers. We can adjust this schedule based on your symptoms, comfort level, and birth preparation needs.</div>
